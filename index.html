            <p>I am a Bachelor graduate in Interactive Media, and a seasoned QA tester, now looking to progress further and become a web developer. I’ve been working on big titles
            since joining the industry in teams of all sizes, having large responsibility ensuring milestone deliverables are being met, as
            well as working well with my colleagues, taking charge when necessary and teaching more junior staff how to do the work
            in the business. Additionally I have worked closely with the different departments and therefore got vast experience when it comes
            to the issues arising and how to solve them efficiently. Since joining the industry, I have been working in Localisation QA
            (LQA) as a Tester, Team Lead and Project Manager at Universally Speaking, and currently working as a QA Tester at The
            Chinese Room (Sumo Digital), having my hands in projects like Beat Saber, Mafia: Definitive Edition and many, many more.
            This has given me vast experience working with teams both internally and externally.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I’m a Norwegian woman with a burning passion for software development and the joy of creating. My spare time goes to study programming and developing websites, to both 
                    extend my knowledge and to be able to create everything I desire. I want to make all sorts of websites and apps that will be for my own benefit and others,
                    but I don't want to stop there, since I also want to code and design my own games in my spare time. 
                    I also love trying to be as active as possible and I am a diehard animal lover (so dogs in office is always a bonus!)
